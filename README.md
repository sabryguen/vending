# I hope that you enjoy marking this as much as I enjoyed coding it :-)

There are essentially 3 projects

TicketArena.Vending.WinForms.TestClient: is a small windows forms app that exercises the VendingManger from business and subscribes to the events that it fires.

TicketArena.Business: contains the core logic to meet the .Net requirements.

TicketArena.Business.Tests: tests for the business layer

TicketArena.Domain: contains the domain classes for the problem.

Please note that I didn't provide unit test coverage for the test app since this was a small rig to show the VendingManager flows. 

Thanks for taking a look.

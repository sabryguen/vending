# I hope that you enjoy marking this as much as I enjoyed coding it :-)

There are essentially 4 projects - developed using VS2015

1- TicketArena.Vending.WinForms.TestClient: is a small windows forms app that exercises the VendingManger from business and subscribes to the events that it fires.

2- TicketArena.Business: contains the core logic to meet the .Net requirements.

3- TicketArena.Business.Tests: tests for the business layer

4- TicketArena.Domain: contains the domain classes for the problem.

Please note that I didn't provide unit test coverage for the test app since this was a small rig to show the VendingManager flows. 

Thanks for taking a look.
